This post consists of my thoughts and my thoughts only on this matter. No other mods were involved in the writing of this post. In addition, please be decent human beings. Do not go out and harass any mod, TG or otherwise. Many of them are my friends and none of them had any knowledge of this or input on it. Thank you.
In addition, check out Cheese_Addict&amp;rsquo;s transparency document here, as it provides a more general overview of the whole ordeal, and this article assumes you&amp;rsquo;ve read that and references screenshots from it.</description>
