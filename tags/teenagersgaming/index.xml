      <description>Preface Reading this, you may find it quite odd that I&amp;rsquo;m writing reviews about pop-tarts of all things, but then again if you know me it might make a little more sense. That being said, hear me out. The origin of this series of reviews is a story that starts around 11 months ago from the writing of this post, in late March of 2021.
At the time, my life was very different than it is now.</description>

This post consists of my thoughts and my thoughts only on this matter. No other mods were involved in the writing of this post. In addition, please be decent human beings. Do not go out and harass any mod, TG or otherwise. Many of them are my friends and none of them had any knowledge of this or input on it. Thank you.
In addition, check out Cheese_Addict&amp;rsquo;s transparency document here, as it provides a more general overview of the whole ordeal, and this article assumes you&amp;rsquo;ve read that and references screenshots from it.</description>
