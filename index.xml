      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write a coffee review. I have zero qualification to do so, but the fact that my blood is 75% caffeine helps.
This is going to be the first of a series of reviews on the odd coffee beverages I consume to summon enough energy to get through the workday. The subject of this review is Five Star Strong Vanilla Cold Brew.
I picked this up from my local grocery store this morning, after seeing it around for a while.</description>

      <description>Yeah I made a blog. What are you going to do about it?
It&amp;rsquo;s in light mode. Why? Because it is.
Deal with it.
